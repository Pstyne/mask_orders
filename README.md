# Mask Orders

This project was something I did for my wife so she could keep track of her mask orders.

This project was built using Rails 6.0.2, Ruby 2.7.0.

Postgres is also used.

Size, style, and pattern are all models which I felt would make it easier to create the masks,
all of which just require a name.

First create an order by creating a name for the order then click on the name to begin adding masks.

I feel like the process is pretty stright forward once you try it out.

If you decide to fork this project I should remind you to alter the seed file to suit your needs.
